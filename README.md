# CPP

> Collection of C++ scripts I made during Computer Science classes.

## Disclaimer

C++ is not my primary programming language and my understanding of it is very limited. Keep that in mind before exploring the scripts.

## Currently available scripts:

* `a.cpp` - prints a big letter A, accepts size as a parameter.
* `euklides.cpp` - calculated the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a number, uses recursive function.
* `fibonacci.cpp` - prints the nth fibonacci number.
* `k.cpp` - prints a big letter K, accepts size as a parameter.
* `kolo.cpp` - prints a circle, accepts radius as a parameter.
* `miejsca-zerowe.cpp` - calculates zero places of a quadratic function.
